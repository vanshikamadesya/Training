		When bleeding occurs in an organ or body part, a process is set in motion to stop the bleeding. This is called hemostasis. To work, hemostasis requires an adequate number of platelets, the right amount of blood clotting proteins (often referred to as factors), and blood vessels that constrict properly. When an injury occurs, the wall of the blood vessel breaks. A normally responsive blood vessel will narrow so that blood flows more slowly, allowing the clotting process to begin. Platelets also rush to the broken wall where certain proteins change the plateletsâ€™ shape from round to spiny so that they can stick to blood cells, the broken vessel wall, and to each other. Other proteins form long strands called fibrin. These fibrin strands form a net that traps and helps hold together the platelets and blood cells, creating a clot that plugs the break in the vessel wall. After the clot has formed and stabilized, other proteins stop the clotting process and eventually dissolve the clot.

		Bleeding disorders may be present at birth (congenital) or occur later. Defects in blood clotting proteins usually show up as delayed bleeding and bruising deep in tissues, bleeding into joints or body cavities, or the formation of hematomas (a pocket of blood that forms outside of a blood vessel). Platelet defects usually show up as superficial small bruises, nosebleeds, black stools caused by bleeding into the bowels, or prolonged bleeding at injection and surgery sites.

		Animals can also clot excessively. These disorders, called hypercoagulable states, can lead to blocked arteries. They can occur due to inherited disorders of anticlotting proteins or can be acquired. Acquired clotting diseases are more common in animals than are inherited disorders.

		Blood clotting tests can help identify animals with defective clotting proteins. However, the tests are not very sensitive, so an animal must have a severe deficiency for the tests to find the problem. Newer tests may provide more information, but they are not widely available.

		Bleeding disorders include clotting protein disorders, platelet disorders, and vascular disorders. The ones that are most common in cats are described below.

				Erythrocytosis (often referred to as polycythemia) is an increase in the number of red blood cells in the bloodstream. (Polycythemia varies from erythrocytosis in that polycythemia may also refer to an increase in white blood cells or platelets.) Primary erythrocytosis (polycythemia vera) is a disease in which the blood-producing cells in the bone marrow develop and reproduce abnormally. It has been reported in cats. Red blood cell production is dramatically increased, and levels of the hormone that stimulates development of red blood cells (erythropoietin) are low or normal. In secondary erythrocytosis (secondary polycythemia), red blood cell production increases in response to increased erythropoietin levels. This may be seen in severe lung disease, heart abnormalities, abnormalities of blood circulation, certain kidney diseases, and some types of tumors. Cats with hyperthyroidism (a disease caused by excessive production of thyroid hormone) or acromegaly (a disease caused by excessive production of growth hormone) may also have erythrocytosis that is too mild to cause any signs.

				Your veterinarian will use tests of blood and urine to help diagnose erythrocytosis. In some cases, x-rays and other tests may also be required. Signs of the disorder include red mucous membranes, bleeding tendencies, the passing of large amounts of urine, excessive thirst, seizures or behavioral changes, lack of coordination, weakness, and blindness. Treatment of erythrocytosis includes removing red blood cells by withdrawing blood through a catheter placed in a vein, then replacing the lost blood with fluids. Drugs such as hydroxyurea may also be added to the treatment. In some cases, the underlying disease must be treated.
